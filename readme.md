Web Interface for Data Tables

This project focuses on creating a user-friendly web interface primarily intended for database administrators. 
The interface allows efficient management and manipulation of data tables in a database. 
The project's main goal is to provide an intuitive web interface for database administrators to interact with data tables. 
This interface showcases the functionalities of various tables and relationships within the database. 

Key aspects of the project: 

The database is pre-populated with sample data that effectively demonstrates the functionality of each table. This includes highlighting many-to-many relationships, giving users a clear understanding of the database's capabilities. 

The primary focus of this project is to create a robust web interface tailored for data table management. It's important to note that this interface is not intended for end-users but rather for database administrators. Therefore, features like user authentication, registration, shopping carts, and checkout processes are not implemented. 

The number of web app pages corresponds to the number of tables in the database. Each data table has a dedicated web page. In the case of a many-to-many relationship, both related tables are managed on a single web page. A home page can is optionally included to provide an entry point to the interface. 

The web interface encompasses various essential functionalities: 
- Insert: Database administrators can insert new entries into individual tables.
- Select: Using SELECT queries, the content of each table can be displayed.
- Update and Delete: The interface supports at least one update and one delete function for an entity.
- Moreover, the project facilitates adding and removing entries from many-to-many relationships. 
- Dynamic Drop-down/Search: Instead of manually inputting IDs, foreign keys are selected through dynamically populated drop-down lists or text-based searches, enhancing usability.
